   - Customers scan the QR code to access the menu and place an order.  

2. **Place Order:**  
   - Once the order is placed, it is sent to the backend for processing.  

3. **Real-Time Order Updates:**  
   - Customers receive live updates about their order status (e.g., Confirmed, Preparing, Ready to Serve).

### **2. Restaurant Flow**
1. **Admin Panel:**  
   - Restaurants use the admin panel to manage menu items, track orders, and assign tables.  
   - Real-time notifications alert staff about new orders or updates.  

2. **Order Management:**  
   - Orders are displayed in the admin panel, categorized by table and order status.  
   - Staff can update the status of each order, which is reflected in the customer view.  

3. **POS Integration (Optional):**  
   - Orders can be routed to the restaurant’s existing POS system if required.
